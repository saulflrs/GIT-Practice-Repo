we begin with REPO
then we have COMMITS which save our chagnges
from this we get unique identifiers called a HASH
then we have a BRANCH
we begin with a MASTER ROOT to the tree to which we can add BRANCHES
then we can change the file if we do not want to commit to the master by working on a BRANCh and not mess with the original
