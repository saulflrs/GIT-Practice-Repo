Life and all its stories
they are but one and all the needs that we want in our life
how can we be so blind?
the one and only is the request that we might make?
These goofy ideas all came to my head at the last moment in order for me to be able to experiment with Github and maybe finally 
learn GIT. 

From what i understand REPO is like a master file
Commit is the equivalent of saving

oh and then i can edit a file while im in it and then all i have to do ir commit again so that it will save my new changes

after line 13 i have made some changes which will allow me to see what is going on in git. hopfully it all goes well. 

adding the color yellow and blue would be weird
